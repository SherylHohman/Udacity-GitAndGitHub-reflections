1) "Section: When to Use a Remote repository"
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I want to share the repository with others. 
    If I'm collaborating with others on this repository.
    If this is a fork of another's repository.
    If I want to access it remotely (ie another machine, show others, backup, copy to another computer..)
    If I want to use other github features.
    Backup -though not a proper backup system, ...

2) "Manual vs. Automatic Pull"
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There could be possible merge issues. 
    When I'm working on some files, I need to know they are in the state I expect them to be in.
    Files and code could become non-senseicle. I want to remain control.
    Perhaps I do not approve.

3) "Forks, Clones, and Branches"
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  
Fork essentially clones somebody else's GitHub repository to one's own repository.
Clone copies a repository (probably GitHub, or git) to a local git repository
Branches can exist on any repository. It shows where code diverges from  a code base. 
	It is a subset of altered files within a reposittory.

When would you use one instead of another?
	- Branch to alter code, but keep it sandboxed from the master (or other) branch of your repository (local or remote).
	- Clone to create an exact copy of your local git repository elsewhere on your machine.
	  or to create an exact copy of your GitHub repository onto your local machine.
	  or to create an exact copy of someone's else's GitHub repository that you have contributor permissions to alter (merge, etc).
	- Fork to create a copy of someone else's repository that you do not have collaborator permissions to.  This allows you to modify the code to your heart's content, on your own copy,  but doesn't directly alter the repository that you forked from.  Fork is uniquely a GitHub command.  It is not a part of git, on one's local machine.
